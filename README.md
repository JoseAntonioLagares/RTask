Inside the source code you might see 2 class:

	RTask.java
		The main class.
	Utils.java
		Contains useful methods inorder to resolve the task.
		
Inside utils.java there are 2 ways or function to solve the problem:

	path1
		A complete way to solve the problem using function "eval" and the text of exe.R script. By default, this option is selected.

DataSet 
======= 
The well known dataset of Iris is used[1]. This data is loaded using the following sentences in the script:

	library(class)
	data(iris)

The data set contains 3 classes in 45 instances, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are not linearly separable from each other. Furthermore, the predicted attribute is the class of iris plant.
